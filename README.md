**Structure**
The index.js file is the entry point and is divided into 4 sections
1. Setup and imports
2. Solution 1 using dependency inversion
3. Solution 2 a more simple alternative
4. Notes on examples for calling into a real database

*The project maninly uses an in-memory repository for data storage but also provides notes for other database solutions like MongoDB*

**Build:**   
You will need to have Node.js and npm installed.  
After cloning this repo run the following commands in the terminal:
``` 
cd <assignment-directory>
npm install
npm start
```

**Dependencies**
1. Nodemon
2. Express
3. Joi
4. MongoDB (not really used but just in case)
